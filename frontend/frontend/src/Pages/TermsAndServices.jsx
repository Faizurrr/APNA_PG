          1. Acceptance of Terms
        </h2>
        <p>
          By using our website and services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,

          2. User Responsibilities
        </h2>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information they provide. 
          You must not post misleading, false, or offensive content. APNA PG reserves the 
          right to remove any listings or suspend accounts that violate our terms.

          3. Property Listings
        </h2>
        <p>
          PG owners are solely responsible for the authenticity of their listings. 
          Tenants should verify details before making any payments or commitments. 
          APNA PG acts as a platform to connect owners and tenants, not as a broker.

          4. Payments & Fees
        </h2>
        <p>
          Currently, listing your PG is free. In the future, PG Finder may introduce 
          premium features or listing fees, which will be communicated to users in advance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">
          5. Limitation of Liability
        </h2>
        <p>
          APNA PG is not responsible for any disputes, damages, or losses that may occur 
          between PG owners and tenants. Users are encouraged to perform due diligence before 
          entering into any agreements.
